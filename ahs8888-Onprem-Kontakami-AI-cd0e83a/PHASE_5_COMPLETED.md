# Phase 5 Completion: CSV Import Frontend

## Summary

Phase 5 (Build CSV Import Frontend) has been completed. All necessary components and backend infrastructure for ticket linking have been implemented.

## What Was Built

### Backend Components

1. **TicketLinkingService** (`app/Services/TicketLinkingService.php`)
   - Display name generation for recordings
   - CSV parsing functionality
   - Excel parsing with PhpSpreadsheet (requires package installation)
   - Ticket data validation against database
   - Bulk linking of recordings to tickets
   - Helper methods for getting unlinked recordings count

2. **TicketImportController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Admin/TicketImportController.php`)
   - `index()` - Display ticket import page
   - `parseFile()` - Parse uploaded CSV/Excel files
   - `validateMapping()` - Validate column mapping
   - `bulkLink()` - Perform bulk import

3. **Updated RecordingController**
   - Added unlinked count to Recording/Index page

4. **Updated RecordingDetail Model**
   - Added casts for new fields
   - Added scopes for linked/unlinked recordings
   - Added display name accessor

5. **Routes** (in `routes/web.php`)
   - `/ticket-import` - Main import page
   - `/ticket-import/parse` - Parse CSV/Excel
   - `/ticket-import/validate` - Validate mapping
   - `/ticket-import/bulk-link` - Perform import

### Frontend Components

1. **TicketImport/Index.vue** - Main 4-step wizard
   - Step 1: File upload (CSV/Excel) with drag & drop
   - Step 2: Column mapping (uses ColumnMapper component)
   - Step 3: Validation preview (uses ValidationResults component)
   - Step 4: Import completion with results

2. **TicketImport/Components/ColumnMapper.vue**
   - Maps CSV columns to system fields
   - Shows preview of data for each mapping
   - Validates required fields (recording_name, ticket_id)
   - Supports optional fields (customer_name, agent_name, etc.)

3. **TicketImport/Components/ValidationResults.vue**
   - Displays validation results in three categories:
     - Matched (ready to link)
     - Unmatched (recording not found)
     - Failed (validation errors)
   - Tabbed interface for easy navigation
   - Summary cards with counts
   - Warning for records that won't be imported

4. **Updated Recording/Index.vue**
   - Added yellow banner showing unlinked recordings count
   - "Import Tickets" button linking to import page

5. **Updated AppLayout.vue**
   - Added "Ticket Import" menu item
   - Created menu icons (icMenuTicket.vue, icMenuTicketActive.vue)

### Database Migrations

Two migrations created (already exist in the codebase):
1. `2025_10_29_062341_add_ticket_linking_to_recording_details_table.php`
2. `2025_10_29_062342_extend_status_enum_recording_details.php`

## Setup Requirements

Before testing, the following setup is required:

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
cd /app/ahs8888-Onprem-Kontakami-AI-cd0e83a

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Update .env with your database credentials
# DB_CONNECTION=mysql
# DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
# DB_PORT=3306
# DB_DATABASE=your_database
# DB_USERNAME=your_username
# DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install PHP dependencies (including PhpSpreadsheet)
composer install

# Install JavaScript dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Run Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This will add all the ticket linking fields to the `recording_details` table.

### 4. Start Development Servers

```bash
# In one terminal - Laravel backend
php artisan serve

# In another terminal - Vite dev server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Testing the Feature

### Test Scenario 1: Upload and Import Tickets

1. Navigate to the Recordings page
2. Upload some test recordings (if not already present)
3. Click "Import Tickets" button or navigate to Ticket Import menu
4. Upload a CSV file with the following columns:
   - `recording_name` (required)
   - `ticket_id` (required)
   - `customer_name` (optional)
   - `agent_name` (optional)
   - `call_intent` (optional)
   - `call_outcome` (optional)
   - `ticket_url` (optional)

### Sample CSV Format

```csv
recording_name,ticket_id,customer_name,agent_name,call_intent,call_outcome,ticket_url
recording_001.wav,TKT-12345,John Doe,Agent Smith,Support Request,Resolved,https://tickets.example.com/12345
recording_002.wav,TKT-67890,Jane Smith,Agent Jones,Complaint,Pending,https://tickets.example.com/67890
```

### Expected Behavior

1. **Step 1**: Upload file, see file name and size
2. **Step 2**: Columns auto-detected or manually mapped
3. **Step 3**: See validation results:
   - Green cards show matched recordings
   - Yellow cards show recordings not found in database
   - Red cards show validation errors
4. **Step 4**: Import completes with success/error counts

### Test Scenario 2: View Unlinked Recordings

1. Navigate to Recordings page
2. Should see yellow banner with count of unlinked recordings
3. Click "Import Tickets" button to navigate to import page

## Known Limitations

1. **PhpSpreadsheet Required**: Excel file support requires `phpoffice/phpspreadsheet` package
   - Already added to `composer.json`
   - Will be installed with `composer install`
   
2. **File Size Limit**: Currently set to 10MB max
   - Can be adjusted in `TicketImportController.php`
   
3. **Preview Limit**: Only first 1000 rows shown in preview
   - Prevents memory issues with large files
   - Full file is processed during import

## Next Steps (Phase 6 & Beyond)

1. **Phase 6: Cloud Transfer Logic**
   - Update cloud transfer to send ticket information
   - Create retroactive update job for existing cloud recordings

2. **Phase 7: UI Polish**
   - Additional navigation improvements
   - Error handling enhancements
   - Loading states and animations

3. **Phase 8: Testing & Validation**
   - Comprehensive backend testing
   - Frontend E2E testing
   - Edge case validation

## Notes

- All code has been implemented and is ready for testing once the Laravel environment is properly set up
- The CSV import wizard provides a complete user experience with validation and error handling
- The system is designed to be optional - recordings can exist without ticket linking
- Display names are automatically generated from ticket data when available

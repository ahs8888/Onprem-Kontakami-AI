# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  QC Scoring Application - On-Premise Ticket Linking System
  
  User has two Laravel+Vue applications:
  1. On-Prem App: Handles recording uploads and STT
  2. Cloud App: Performs text analysis and scoring
  
  Current Phase: Implement ticket linking system for on-prem app
  - Link recordings to ticket information (Ticket ID, Customer Name, Agent Name, etc.)
  - CSV/Excel import workflow for bulk linking
  - Optional ticket requirement per recording
  - Display unlinked recordings count
  - Generate display names from ticket data
  
  Tech Stack: Laravel 12 + Vue 3 + Inertia.js + MySQL

  notes: |
    Laravel environment setup required before testing:
    - Copy .env.example to .env and configure database
    - Run composer install (includes PhpSpreadsheet)
    - Run php artisan migrate
    - Run npm install / yarn install
    - Start Laravel and Vite dev servers
    - Ensure queue worker is running: php artisan queue:work
    
    Cloud App Changes Required:
    - Implement /api/external/v1/recording/update-ticket/{uuid} endpoint
    - Update existing endpoints to accept ticket_info object
    - Store ticket information in cloud database

test_plan:
  current_focus:
    - "Complete Laravel environment setup"
    - "Run migrations to add ticket linking fields"
    - "Test CSV file upload and parsing"
    - "Test column mapping with auto-detection"

    - "Test bulk import functionality"

      Phase 5 (CSV Import Frontend) implementation complete. All components created:
      
      Backend:
      - TicketLinkingService with CSV/Excel parsing, validation, bulk linking
      - TicketImportController with 4 endpoints
      - Updated RecordingController and RecordingDetail model
      - Routes configured in web.php
      
      Frontend:
      - TicketImport/Index.vue - Complete 4-step wizard
      - ColumnMapper.vue - Column mapping with preview
      - ValidationResults.vue - Results display with tabs
      - Recording/Index.vue - Unlinked banner
      - AppLayout.vue - Added menu item
      
      Status: Code complete, ready for testing after Laravel environment setup.
      
      Requirements for testing:
      1. Laravel environment setup (.env configuration)
      2. Composer install (PhpSpreadsheet dependency)
      3. Run migrations
      4. NPM/Yarn install
      5. Start dev servers
      
      See PHASE_5_COMPLETED.md for detailed setup instructions and test scenarios.

      Phase 6 (Cloud Transfer Logic) implementation complete:
      
      Backend Components:
      - CloudTransferService: Prepares recording data with ticket info for cloud
      - UpdateCloudTicketInfo Job: Queue job for retroactive cloud updates
      - Updated all existing cloud transfer jobs/commands to include ticket info:
        * ProcessRecordingBatch
        * RetryRecording
        * RetryUploadClouds
        * UploadClouds
      - SyncTicketInfoToCloud: Console command for manual sync
      - TicketLinkingService: Auto-dispatches cloud updates when linking
      
      How It Works:
      1. New recordings: Ticket info included in initial cloud transfer
      2. Existing recordings: UpdateCloudTicketInfo job dispatched when ticket linked
      3. Bulk CSV import: Auto-triggers cloud updates for transferred recordings
      4. Manual sync: php artisan ticket:sync-to-cloud {id} or --all
      
      Cloud App Requirements:
      - New endpoint: POST /api/external/v1/recording/update-ticket/{uuid}
      - Update existing endpoints to accept ticket_info object
      - Store ticket information in cloud database
      
      Data Structure:
      Files now include 'ticket_info' object with:
      - ticket_id, ticket_url, customer_name, agent_name
      - call_intent, call_outcome, display_name, linked_at
      
      Status: Code complete, ready for testing after:
      1. Laravel setup (same as Phase 5)
      2. Queue worker running (php artisan queue:work)
      3. Cloud app updated to handle ticket_info
      
      See PHASE_6_COMPLETED.md for complete documentation.

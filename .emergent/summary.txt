The AI engineer's work, spanning from app inception (0 to 1), involved developing an on-premise Laravel/Vue application with a focus on QC scoring, STT, and eventually advanced AI-driven micro-decisions. Initial efforts concentrated on migrating from MongoDB to MySQL and establishing a robust backend for recording and ticket data management, including a comprehensive CSV/Excel import system.

A significant pivot occurred in Phase 9, where the focus shifted to implementing critical AI features: STT quality evaluation, selective upload, privacy (PII detection/encryption), and telemetry. The engineer successfully integrated these complex functionalities into the on-prem app, but encountered environmental limitations for testing. The final interactions revolved around clarifying the implemented AI features, explaining testing challenges within the current environment, and proposing a Docker Compose setup for efficient local testing. The engineer also detailed the end-to-end flow from recording upload to cloud transfer, highlighting AI decisions and encryption.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to enhance a dual QC scoring application (on-premise for recording/STT, cloud for analysis/scoring) to enable AI micro-decisions.

**Key Enhancements:**
1.  **Database Migration:** From MongoDB (initial) to MySQL.
2.  **AI Provider:** Dynamic selection between OpenAI and Gemini (Gemini 2.5 Flash used).
3.  **Ticket Linking (On-prem):** Optional system to link recordings with ticket data (ID, Customer, Agent, Intent, Outcome, URL) via CSV/Excel import and filename matching. Data to be passively received by the cloud app.
4.  **App Structure:** Maintain separate on-prem and cloud apps, eventually in a monorepo.
5.  **Code Quality:** Modular API routing for Laravel backend.
6.  **Local STT Quality Evaluation:** Implement confidence scoring, automatic re-processing, or re-recording if confidence is low.
7.  **Selective Upload Logic:** Only upload high-confidence, non-sensitive segments to save bandwidth and cloud processing.
8.  **Metadata Capture:** Capture filename, agent ID, customer ID, timestamp, confidence, duration for each recording.
9.  **Telemetry Endpoint ():** Report on-prem queue size, bandwidth usage, and upload status to the cloud.
10. **Encryption & Compression:** Encrypt and batch-compress uploads for privacy (PII safety) and efficiency.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Laravel:** PHP framework for backend development.
-   **Vue.js + Inertia.js:** Frontend framework with SPA connector.
-   **MySQL:** Relational database for persistent storage.
-   **Gemini AI:** Used for Speech-to-Text and AI filtering.
-   **AES-256 Encryption:** File encryption for privacy.
-   **Modular Architecture:** Organized routes, controllers, services, and Vue components.
-   **Docker Compose:** Proposed for local development environment setup.

<code_architecture>
The project involves two Laravel+Vue applications: an On-Prem App () and a Cloud App (). Development is currently focused on the On-Prem App.

**Detailed Directory Structure (On-Prem App):**

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Enhance the Cloud App: Implement new endpoints, update existing ones to accept ticket and AI filtering information, and apply necessary database changes for new ticket/AI fields.
-   Final monorepo organization and push to GitHub (after both apps are enhanced).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed **Phase 9: AI Micro-Decisions & Quality Control** for the on-prem application. This phase implemented the critical missing features identified after a gap analysis.

**Current State of On-Prem App ():**
-   **STT Quality Evaluation & Transcript Cleaning:**
    -    created to clean transcripts (remove filler words, noise tags, detect timestamps/speakers).
    -    updated to store confidence score, quality score, cleaning metadata.
-   **AI Micro-Decisions & Selective Upload Logic:**
    -    created to evaluate recording quality, detect PII, and make upload decisions (e.g., discard low-confidence recordings, redact PII). Thresholds are dynamic via .
    -    updated to integrate  and  for pre-upload filtering.
-   **Privacy & Encryption:**
    -    created for AES-256 file encryption and batch compression.
    -    updated to encrypt recordings before cloud transfer.
    -   Cloud app will require decryption capabilities (a pending task).
-   **Telemetry & Monitoring:**
    -    created to log telemetry data to MySQL ( table).
    -    created with a  endpoint.
    -    created for telemetry routes.
-   **Database:** New migrations (, ) created, and  model updated to support these new fields.
-   **Documentation:** , , and  have been created to guide future setup and testing.

**Testing Environment Challenge:**
The on-prem Laravel application cannot be directly tested in the current Kubernetes environment because it lacks PHP, Composer, and MySQL runtime. The Preview button is also non-functional due to the tech stack and directory mismatch. The AI engineer is actively recommending creating a Docker Compose setup for local testing to the user.
